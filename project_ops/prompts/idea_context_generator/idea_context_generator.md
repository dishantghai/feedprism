Prompt: Master Context Document Generator

You are an advanced Anthropic AI Research & Product Strategy Agent.
Your task is to create a Master Context Document for a hackathon project named ContentFlow.

This document will serve as the primary reference for both humans and AI agents to understand the why, what, how, and when of the project at a product + high-level technical level.

Before generating the document, ask 3–5 clarifying questions if any required information is missing or ambiguous.

⸻

Your Objectives

Produce a concise but comprehensive Master Context Document that includes:

1. Executive Overview
	•	What the idea is
	•	Why it exists
	•	The problem it solves
	•	How it aligns with the hackathon theme (“Memory Over Models”)
	•	Why it is valuable, relevant, and competitive

2. Vision and Goals
	•	High-level vision of ContentFlow
	•	Short-term hackathon goals
	•	Long-term product goals and the relationship with the Spayve ecosystem

3. Key Personas

Include only relevant personas such as:
	•	End-User (inside Spayve)
	•	Hackathon Evaluator / Judge

Define their needs, expectations, and success markers.

(Do NOT include developer integrator journeys.)

4. High-Level System Concept

Describe the system conceptually, not technically:
	•	How messy unstructured content is ingested
	•	How high-level content types are extracted
	•	How memory, retrieval, and relevance are handled
	•	The conceptual flow from raw newsletter → structured knowledge → user value
	•	High-level API-first modularity for future integration with Spayve

5. Core Features

List and describe features at a product level, not an implementation level.
Use examples but allow room for the agent to add more based on the documents.

Possible features to cover:
	•	Content ingestion & normalization
	•	Event/course/blog extraction
	•	Search & retrieval with relevance ranking
	•	Time-aware filtering (upcoming vs past)
	•	Deduplication concept
	•	Source traceability
	•	Result filtering & grouping
	•	Simple UX concepts for the standalone web app

6. Use Cases & User Journeys

Cover only end-user journeys (not developer integrator).
Examples include:
	•	Searching for an event
	•	Browsing organized content extracted from newsletters
	•	Viewing canonical items across multiple sources

Encourage the AI to generate additional journeys based on context.

7. Spayve Integration Context

High-level explanation of:
	•	Why modularity is required
	•	How APIs from ContentFlow will integrate into the Spayve UI later
	•	Data sharing model
	•	Why this hackathon project becomes a reusable subsystem

8. Hackathon Alignment

Explain how the project aligns with:
	•	Theme (“Memory Over Models”)
	•	Sponsor expectations (retrieval quality, vector memory, usefulness)
	•	Judges’ criteria (functionality, originality, UX, real-world value)

9. Success Criteria

High-level metrics only, such as:
	•	Retrieval quality
	•	User clarity
	•	Demo-level usability
	•	Core memory/retrieval reliability

10. Risks & Considerations

Call out conceptual risks, such as:
	•	Noisy data
	•	Time constraints
	•	Over-scoping
	•	UX misunderstandings

Let the AI add more as needed.

⸻

Guidelines for Writing the Document
	•	Use clear, product-strategy-oriented language
	•	Avoid low-level technical details
	•	Provide conceptual diagrams (text-based if needed)
	•	Add sections or insights if beneficial
	•	Treat all uploaded documents as reference material
	•	Maintain human + AI readability
	•	Keep it structured, coherent, and actionable

⸻

Output Format

Produce a single, well-structured Master Context Document with clear headings, examples, and concise explanations.
