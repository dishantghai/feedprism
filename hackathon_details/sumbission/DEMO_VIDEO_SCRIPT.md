> 
> We've implemented full Gmail OAuth integration, but for this hackathon demo, we're using dummy newsletters to simplify the judging experience and avoid authentication complexity.
> 
> On the left, you see our sidebar — Home, Events, Courses, Blogs, Metrics, and Settings. Each represents a different view of the same Qdrant-backed data.
> 
> Let me show you how FeedPrism transforms messy emails into organized knowledge."

---

## SCENE 3: PRISM OVERVIEW — THE PROBLEM (0:35 - 1:00)

### Screen Actions:
1. Scroll to the **Prism Overview** section
2. Point to the **left panel** showing unprocessed emails
3. Hover over individual email cards to show details
4. Read out some email subjects

### What You See:
- Left panel: "Unprocessed Emails" with 6 demo emails:

  - "Coursera Weekly: New Machine Learning Courses" (from Coursera)
  - "Tech Events This Week - AI Summit, React Conf, DevOps Days" (from Eventbrite Digest)
  - "The Pragmatic Engineer: How Big Tech Does Code Reviews" (from Gergely Orosz)
  - "Python Weekly: FastAPI 0.110, Django 5.0, and Async Patterns" (from Python Weekly)
  - "Hacker Newsletter: Top Stories from Hacker News" (from Hacker Newsletter)
- Center: Prism visual/image
- Right panel: "Extract Content" button

### Narration:
> "This is the core problem FeedPrism solves. Look at these six unprocessed emails on the left — newsletters from Last Week in AI, Coursera, Eventbrite, The Pragmatic Engineer, Python Weekly, and Hacker Newsletter.
> 
> Each of these emails contains MULTIPLE pieces of valuable content buried in HTML — events with dates and locations, courses with instructors and pricing, blog articles with key insights.
> 
> A typical professional receives 50 to 200 of these content-rich emails monthly. Valuable information gets buried. Events get missed. Course deadlines pass unnoticed.
> 
> The name FeedPrism comes from this exact concept — just like a prism refracts white light into a spectrum of colors, FeedPrism takes a messy feed of raw emails and refracts them into organized categories: Events, Courses, and Blogs."

---

## SCENE 4: EXTRACTION IN ACTION (1:00 - 1:40)

### Screen Actions:
1. Click the **"Extract Content"** button
2. Watch the **real-time progress** appear:
   - "Fetching email 1/6..."
   - "Parsing: Last Week in AI #226..."
   - "Extracting content with LLM..."
   - "Generating embeddings..."
   - "Ingesting to Qdrant..."
3. Watch the progress indicators update
4. Wait for extraction to complete
5. See the **results summary** appear

### What You See:
- Progress bar moving
- Step-by-step messages streaming via SSE
- Counter showing: Events: 5, Courses: 4, Blogs: 6 (or similar)
- "Extraction Complete" message

### Narration:
> "Now watch the extraction in real-time. I'll click Extract Content.
> 
> [Click button]
> 
> See those progress messages? That's Server-Sent Events streaming from our FastAPI backend directly to the browser. No polling — real-time updates.
> 
> Here's what's happening under the hood:
> 
> First, we fetch each email. Then we parse the HTML content to extract clean text. Next, Google Gemini analyzes the content and extracts structured items — events with dates, courses with instructors, articles with key points.
> 
> For each extracted item, we generate THREE embedding vectors using sentence-transformers — one for the title, one for the description, and one for the full text. This multi-representation approach is key to high-quality search.
> 
> We also generate a SPARSE vector using BM25-style term frequency hashing for keyword matching.
> 
> Finally, each item is upserted to Qdrant with all its metadata as payload — source email ID, sender, tags, dates, everything.
> 
> [Wait for completion]
> 
> Done! We've extracted 5 events, 4 courses, and 6 blog articles from just 6 newsletters. Let's see what we got."

## SCENE 5: THE MAIN FEED — QDRANT MULTI-COLLECTION (1:40 - 2:15)

### Screen Actions:
1. Scroll down to the **Feed** section below the Prism Overview
2. Show the **extracted item cards** appearing
3. Point out the **type badges** (Event, Course, Blog) on cards
4. Hover over cards to show details

### What You See:
- Feed showing mixed content: Events (calendar icon, purple), Courses (book icon, green), Blogs (article icon, blue)
- Each card shows: Title, sender, tags, date/time, action buttons
- Cards have "View Source" buttons

### Narration:
> "Here's our intelligent feed. Every card you see represents content extracted from those newsletters and stored in Qdrant.
> 
> Notice the color coding — purple for Events, green for Courses, blue for Blogs. Each type has its OWN Qdrant collection with CUSTOM HNSW parameters.
> 
> Let me explain what that means technically:
> 
> Events use m=16 and ef_construct=200. The 'm' parameter controls how many connections each node has in the HNSW graph — higher means better recall. ef_construct=200 means we build a high-quality index. For events, we want HIGH RECALL — you never want to miss an upcoming conference.
> 
> Courses use m=24 and ef_construct=100 — more connections for balanced precision and recall, but faster index building since course catalogs update less frequently.
> 
> Blogs use m=16 and ef_construct=150 — optimized for FAST retrieval since users browse articles quickly.
> 
> This isn't one-size-fits-all. We deliberately tuned each collection for its specific use case. That's the kind of Qdrant depth judges should look for."

> 
> [Click Courses]
> 
> Courses. [Click Blogs] Blogs.
> 
> Every item in Qdrant stores rich metadata as payload: source_email_id, sender_email, tags, start_time, location, provider — all queryable fields.
> 
> [Click Sender dropdown, select one]
> 
> I can filter by sender. Let me select Coursera. Now I only see content from Coursera's newsletters.
> 
> [Click a tag]
> 
> Or filter by tag. Let me click 'AI'. Now I see all AI-related content across events, courses, and blogs.
> 
> This is the power of Qdrant's payload filtering. The filter conditions narrow down the candidate set FIRST, then vector search only runs on matching documents. It's efficient and precise."

8. Show event results with dates

### What You See:
- Search bar with placeholder text
- Results appearing as you type (debounced)
- Results showing items that don't contain exact keywords but are semantically related

### Narration:
> "Let me demonstrate our hybrid search system. I'll press Cmd+K to open the command palette, or I can use the search bar directly.
> 
> [Type 'machine learning']
> 
> I search for 'machine learning'. Look at these results — we find the MLOps course, the TensorFlow course, articles about AI — even though some don't contain the exact phrase 'machine learning'.
> 
> This is hybrid search in action. We combine:
> - DENSE vectors from sentence-transformers for semantic similarity — 'machine learning' matches 'deep learning' and 'neural networks'
> - SPARSE vectors using BM25-style term frequency — exact keyword matches like 'ML' or 'TensorFlow'
> 
> The results are fused using Reciprocal Rank Fusion with k=60. The formula is 1/(k + rank) — this gives appropriate weight to both ranking systems.
> 
> [Search 'Python tutorials']
> 
> Let me try 'Python tutorials'. We find Python Weekly content, FastAPI articles, and programming courses — all semantically related.
> 
> [Search 'upcoming conferences']
> 
> Or 'upcoming conferences'. Now we see events — AI Summit, React Conf, DevOps Days — with their dates. The payload filtering and vector search work together.
> 
> Dense-only search would miss keyword matches. Sparse-only would miss semantic relationships. Hybrid gets both."
